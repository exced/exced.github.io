## Hi there ! 
My name is Thomas, I was raised in South of France.
I studied Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Engineering school in France until summer 2016.
I'm currently pursuing a double degree : M.S. in Computer Science in Canada.

I'm looking for an internship for summer / fall 2017 as software engineer.
I like web technologies and machine learning.

I like practicing ski, ice skating, football. I'd love to travel more in the next years.
