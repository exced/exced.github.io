<p> I love computer science and maths and I wand to test and write every things I'm thinking about... </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">I need a way to be more productive ! </h2>

<p> According to the time I spend writing code I'm thinking <i> Why is there no code-writer AI for us ? Would it be bad ?</i> </p>
<p> The problem is similar to compilers. Compiler knows how to respect grammar rules and what code is generated for an instruction. </p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Determinism </h3>

<p> One wonderful thing in computer science is that you can write lot of different programs that do the same. </p>
<p> In our case we need a system which always produces a similar minimalistic line to do one operation. </p>
