title:      "Fuck you internships"
---

I have long hesitated to post this. But I really hate you, fucking internships.
I do not actually know what does the "careers" section stand for in your fucking website.
I have never had an answer posting on that section.

"What am I doing wrong ?"
I probably have the answer : I tried the normal way. But I was wrong, the normal way is networking.

What is networking ? And how does it help ?
"Networking provides access to business opportunities through a large business network".
Yes it does, I had the opportunity to see it, I did have a fucking answer from a recruiter by emailing.
But I hate it, I hate the folks who tell me that LinkedIn is a powerful tool, the same folks that been power leveled by
a friend or family member.
LinkedIn is bullshit, it stands for people who does not have any talent at all except for selling themselves.
(ofc it's bullshit, MS bought it)
Do you really think you're a good engineer by clicking on "inMail" button or lying about your previous experience ?
I know you guys, you were networking when I was doing your fucking school projects.

Now I do not want to work in your firms anymore, you pissed me off, I do not want to work for people like you.

Oh, finally, I don't care spitting on recruiters since they will never read this. After all, who would read a portfolio for 
choosing an employee ?
