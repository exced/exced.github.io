### Template to build cross-platform desktop app
[Github link](https://github.com/exced/electron-angular-boilerplate)

Electron is a framework to build cross-platform desktop app.
It uses NodeJS and Chromium to render your website as desktop app.
Check out the [Official Electron website](http://electron.atom.io) for more info.

I've built a simple boilerplate that I'll improve later. It shows us how to combine Angular-cli, PhotonKit and Electron 
to render beautiful desktop apps.
You can easily package your app on OSX, Linux & Windows.
