This is a little game of Mario to collect mushrooms and save Peach.

This has been made in few hours (~afternoon). This is quiet ugly but it shows how to compute the 
best path to collect the max mushrooms. 

It is defined as follow : traverse matrix diagonally from end to begin and store the sum of the
max of elements that satisfy moves constraints (in this case down and right).

Then traverse again the matrix diagonally from begin to end maximizing the values in the matrix.
