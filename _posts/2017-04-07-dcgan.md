# Generative Adversarial Networks

I recently heard about how you could generate datas using 2 neural networks.
It is called GAN (stands for Generative Adversarial Network) and is a game with 2 folks : 
- 1 generator
- 1 discriminator
The discriminator is an image classifier and the generator is trying to fool the discriminator by sending a fake image. (i.e. a self generated image).

You can perform function minimization on the difference between fake image and real image.
Therefore you will generate an image that looks like a real one.

# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

This is just an adaptation with deep classifier.
I used 2 fully-strided convolutional layers with Relu as activation function and a fully-connected layer with Sigmoid.
