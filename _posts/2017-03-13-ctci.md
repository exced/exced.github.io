title:      "Cracking the Coding Interview"
---

Cracking the Coding Interview is a book from @gayle that you can find anywhere.
It's a compilation of advices and exercises to train for the Computer Science interviews.

I'm currently working on it for 3 reasons :
1. it's obviously awesome if you do have an interview to prepare.
2. there is a lot of stuff about how data-structures are implemented and things that you could reuse in your life.
3. it's "fun" : there are often two ways to solve a problem : the "easy-way" (i.e. ~bruteforce) and the tricky way. That last point could be surprisingly fun and it opens your mind by making you thinking out of the box.

It's currently in development but I hope to spend few days on it later.
