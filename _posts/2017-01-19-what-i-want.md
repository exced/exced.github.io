As a developper and student, I've spent a crazy time thinking about what I could do after my studies.
<br> The answer is : I want to build things. I know this job does not exist so I have to build it from my own, because folks don't offer job like that.
<br> I'm a dreamer I know, but that makes me happy.

<p>
Here we are : I really love to work on CS and maths but I cannot spend all my life doing boring things.
<br> That is why I will carry on building things.
</p>

<p>
After all the hours spent on coding, I realize that I'm too slow and I won't be able to do what I want.
<br> I need coworkers. People like me who just want to work on crazy subjects and build terrible softwares.
<br> The problem is that I did no found these people yet, so I'm gonna build a meta-soft to enhance my productivity.

<h2 class="section-heading">What I want</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>I want to keep a blog, and post on it.</li>
<li>I want to work on artificial intelligence, focusing on machine learning</li>
<li>As a full-stack developper I want to make a UI for this assistant</li>
<li>I want to share on social media</li>
<li>I want to be aware of crazy new things about CS</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Actually, I sadly think that the key to be more productive is to <b>automate almost everything
 I usually do</b> such as reading blogs, learning new languages, coding.
 <br> I'll first focus on <u>automatic text summarizer</u> to keep my eyes open.
 I think it's a huge start.
