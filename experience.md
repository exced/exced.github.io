## Cross-platform mobile app for drawing recognition
### IRIT lab / CNRS (France) - 3 months
I've built cross-platform mobile app with ionic framework to recognize client draws.
We focused on Clock Drawing Test, which is well-known as a good test to detect old people dementia.
The final purpose is to build an intelligent habitat to let old people be autonomous while being safe.
